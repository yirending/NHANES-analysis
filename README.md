# NHANES-analysis

Analysis of the effects to cholesterol levels among college students based on gender,
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  We use the data from [National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.google.com) for our analysis.  

The original data was in .XPT format, which is a file type used for SASS.  Using the python
package [xport](https://pypi.org/project/xport/), they can be easily converted to .csv format,
which are included here.

# How to view the Analysis
