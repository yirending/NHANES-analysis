# NHANES-analysis

Analysis of the effects to cholesterol levels among college students based on gender,
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  The data used for this project is freely available from [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.google.com).  

The original data is in .XPT, which is a format used for SASS.  Using a Python
package [xport](https://pypi.org/project/xport/), I converted them to .csv format, and
attached them here.

# How to view the Analysis

For a quick view of the analysis, simply open the file NHANES_analysis.html in a web browser.
For more interactive code, open the .ipynb file instead.
